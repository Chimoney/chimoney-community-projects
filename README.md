## About

### Chimoney

[Chimoney](https://chimoney.io/) is a global payments infrastructure provider that enables businesses, organizations and communities to send bulk payments instantly in over 130 countries. Payouts can be redeemed via bank transfers, mobile money, gift cards, and airtime.

### Chimoney API

The [Chimoney API](https://chimoney.readme.io/reference/introduction) lets you programmatically send, receive, and collect payments across borders with support for multiple channels including bank accounts, mobile money wallets, gift cards, and airtime.



Through the integration of the Interledger Protocol (ILP), Chimoney also enables interoperable payments across networks. Developers can issue Interledger Wallet Addresses (Payment Pointers) and allow users to send and receive payments globally, powering use cases like Web Monetization and Open Payments. Learn more [**here.**](https://chimoney.io/blogs/a-developer-s-guide-to-enabling-ilp-payments-with-chimoney/)

[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VItvZbPH9cU&t=4s) to learn more about the Chimoney API.

### Chimoney Community Projects

Chimoney Community Projects are open-source contributions made by developers, writers, and community members using the Chimoney API. They include SDKs in different programming languages, sample applications, integrations, and technical articles that highlight real-world use cases.

> **Note:** Chimoney Community Projects are built using different programming languages and tech stacks. As a result, each project includes its own setup instructions in its individual README file. Be sure to check the specific README for guidance on running or contributing to that project.

## Getting Started with the Chimoney API

To get started with the Chimoney API, sign up for a developer account at [sandbox.chimoney.io](https://sandbox.chimoney.io). This [step-by-step guide](https://www.loom.com/share/436303eb69c44f0d9757ea0c655bed89?sid=b6a0f661-721c-4731-9873-ae6f2d25780) will take you through the process of creating an account, generating your API key, and making your first test payout using the sandbox environment. Once your setup is complete, you can begin exploring the Chimoney API, making requests, and building projects with real-world use cases.

## Chimoney Hacktoberfest

Chimoney has participated in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) every year since 2022, welcoming developers, writers, and designers to contribute to our open-source community.

Each October, we create beginner-friendly **`Hacktoberfest`** issues to make it easier for first-time and seasoned contributors alike to get involved.

We also offer rewards and recognition for meaningful contributions during Hacktoberfest. To explore our past Hacktoberfest recaps, see how you can get involved, and make the most of contributing to Chimoney's open-source projects, read more here.

### Hcktoberfest 2025

Chimoney is participating in Hacktoberfest 2025!✨
This year, along with our existing open-source projects, we’re introducing a brand-new project: **IaaS-k8s**

IaaS-k8s is a multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure deployment solution supporting AWS EKS and GCP GKE, built with Pulumi and TypeScript.

➝ _Learn more about the project and get started here:_ [_IaaS-k8s Project_](https://github.com/Chimoney/Iaas)
