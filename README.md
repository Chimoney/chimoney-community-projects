### **Get Started**
 
 You will need `keys` to interface with our products. To do so, follow these simple steps below:

- Visit the Sandbox Portal: Head over to our Sandbox Portal by clicking here.
- If you haven't already, create your Chimoney Developer account by signing up. If you're an existing member, simply log in.
- Switch to the organization (top right) and go to dev page, you’d see your keys.
- We will add $10 for testing. You can always send $1 to yourself to test and redeem it back to the organization. That way, you always have funds.

 _We can't wait to see your contribution!!!_
