## Obtaining API Keys

1. **Sign up for a Chimoney Developer Account:** See the Sandbox Access Instruction [here](https://sandbox.chimoney.io/developers). If you don't already have one, you'll need to sign up for a Chimoney developer account sandbox access at [sandbox.chimoney.io](https://chimoney.readme.io/reference/sandbox-environment).
