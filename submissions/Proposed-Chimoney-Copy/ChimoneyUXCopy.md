Comment: I broke down this section(section 2) into three - our features(section 2),  more apps(section 3), and coming soon(section 4).
Reason: The UI looked too cluttered on the desktop view and one might get easily confused. Also, on mobile view, they just appeared like a standalone bunch of cards.
Suggestion: The UI needs to be improved so that those cluttered cards would be present in individual sections.

General comments
The UI needs to be configured for the clarity of ideas.
The text carousel at the end of the sections is not necessary, they are distracting. And if any is to be used they can be just one or two.
The cards can be in carousel states instead of the text.
