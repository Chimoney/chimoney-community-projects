A commit message should easily convey what it contains so the guidelines show a commit should be for this project.

The commit message should be in this format `type: subject` where `type` can be any one of these:

- `feat: a new feature`
- `fix: a bug fix`
- `docs: changes to documentation`
- `style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code  change`
- `refactor: refactoring production code`
- `test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change`
- `chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change`

and the `subject` should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with an uppercase and should use imperative tone. E.g: 'change'; not 'changed' or 'changes'
